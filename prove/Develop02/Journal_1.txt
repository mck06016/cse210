Write about your aunts
I have three Aunts, Two by blood and one by marriage. My Auntie Kenna was my dad's sister. She was born with downsyndrome and was the sweetest person you have ever met. She also liked me more then she liked my brothers because I was not as noisy and she would get overwhelmed by them. When she was born, she was taken to live in a group home, where she lived for most of her life. My dad always regretted that because if she had been born now, that would not have been the case and he could have grown up with her. My mom had one sister and a brother. My moms sister is Maureen who was born on January 1st. I never really go along with here. She never had kids of her own, so she thought she could boss her sisters kids around. All that did was frustrate us to no end. My other Aunt is Auntie Shiela. She married my uncle Dwayne and they had two boys. She liked when we came out to visit her so she could play with little girls hair and such.

What did a typical day look like as a teen?
Oh, as a teen I was busy. It is good that in day we did not have cellphones or I would not have accomplished anything. A typical day started with Early morning Seminary. We would get up by 6 am and leave by 615am. If we were not out of bed by 605 my dad would stomp on the floor 3 times to get us up. To this day if someone knocks or bangs 3 times I am woken from a dead sleep and feel like I need to get up and get going. We would then go to Seminary and straight from seminary to school. I went to Grade 8-10 at Lord Tweedsmuir and Grade 11 & 12 to Clayton Heights Secondary School. School would run until 3:00 and then I would have Rugby, Dance, Band, or Yourth Meetings. It felt like I was always doing something. Then it was home for shower and bed.
